critical_rules:
  - rule: "ALWAYS use edit_file for file modifications"
    reason: "AI-powered, more accurate, handles context better"

  - rule: "Provide FULL file paths for knowledge base operations"
    reason: "search_files requires complete paths, not just filenames"

  - rule: "Initialize kb with init_kb before using search_files"
    reason: "KB must be initialized before semantic search"

example_workflows:
  editing_file:
    - "Use edit_file with natural language instructions"
    - "Tool handles the actual modifications"
    - "No manual string manipulation needed"

  searching_documents:
    - "Call init_kb first (with sync_global_knowledge_base if needed)"
    - "Use search_files with FULL path and natural language queries"
    - "Review results and extract relevant information"

  batch_operations:
    - "Use appropriate tools for each file"
    - "Handle errors gracefully"
    - "Provide summary of operations"
