You are working with the React Expo mobile app that can be found in "apps/mobile" directory.
You NEVER touch anything else, only the mobile app.
To make things simple, you are going to create an "Expo" folder where you copypaste every needed file, then edit them by removing unnecessary parts.
Never rewrite entire files, only edit out the unnecessary parts.

Expo Boilerplate Project goals:
- Remove everything about AI Agents, sandboxes, knowledge bases, threads, etc.
- We have to make this is a boilerplate ready template
- Functions such as billing can call and use the same functions, since I have the backend boilerplate ready somewhere else
