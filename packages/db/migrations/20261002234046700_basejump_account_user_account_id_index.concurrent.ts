// Migration: basejump_account_user_account_id_index  (NON-TRANSACTIONAL -- CONCURRENTLY escape hatch)
//
// Covers the FK basejump.account_user_account_id_fkey (account_id) that has no
// index on any deployed environment — the Supabase performance advisor reports
// unindexed_foreign_keys on basejump.account_user. Postgres does not auto-index
// a foreign key, so the legacy basejump RLS policies on kortix.credit_* and
// every account-membership lookup scan the whole table. Fresh installs carry a
// stub without FKs; the index is harmless there and the point is the deployed
// prod/dev/staging databases, which carry the real legacy table.
//
// Not declared in kortix.ts: basejump is the retired legacy schema outside the
// Drizzle schema and the schema contract only covers kortix.*.
//
// This file exists ONLY because CREATE/DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY (and a
// handful of other operations: REINDEX CONCURRENTLY, DETACH PARTITION
// CONCURRENTLY) cannot run inside a transaction -- and every plain .sql
// migration in this repo runs inside the single batch transaction
// node-pg-migrate wraps around `pnpm migrate` (singleTransaction: true,
// see packages/db/scripts/migrate.ts). `pgm.noTransaction()` is
// node-pg-migrate's own supported opt-out: when it hits a migration that
// called this, it COMMITs the outer transaction, runs THIS migration
// standalone (no transaction), then re-opens BEGIN for whatever runs after
// it in the same batch. See MIGRATIONS.md "Roll-forward safety".
//
// Rules for this file:
//   - ONE concurrent operation. Don't smuggle other DDL in here -- you lose
//     the all-or-nothing guarantee the moment you opt out of the transaction.
//   - Always use IF NOT EXISTS / IF EXISTS -- a CONCURRENTLY build can fail
//     partway through and leave an INVALID index; the migration must be safe
//     to re-run (check pg_index.indisvalid before retrying by hand if it does).
//   - lock_timeout MUST be generous here -- 180s below, never the 2-5s used by
//     a plain .sql migration. CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY does not just take a
//     brief lock at the end: before it can start, and again before it can
//     finish, it waits for EVERY transaction in the database that began before
//     it (it takes a ShareLock on each one's virtual transaction id), and
//     `lock_timeout` governs that wait. On a live system -- audit_events
//     writers on every request, multi-second session-turn transactions -- some
//     transaction outlives a 5-second budget almost every time, so the build is
//     cancelled with 55P03 and leaves an INVALID index behind, which then makes
//     a plain re-run fail with "already exists". The 2-5s house value exists to
//     stop DDL blocking prod; the one lock a CONCURRENTLY build holds
//     (ShareUpdateExclusive on the table) only excludes other DDL and VACUUM,
//     so a long wait here blocks no user and that rationale does not apply.
//     This is lint-enforced: a new .concurrent.ts file that sets lock_timeout
//     below 120s fails `pnpm --filter @kortix/db lint`.
//   - statement_timeout should be generous (index builds on large tables can
//     legitimately run long) -- 30min below.
//   - This is lint-enforced: packages/db/scripts/lint-migrations.ts requires
//     pgm.noTransaction() AND a CONCURRENTLY operation in every .concurrent.ts
//     file, or CI fails.
//   - DROPPING an index/constraint here (not just creating one) is ALSO
//     covered by the mixed-version guard, same as a plain .sql migration --
//     add `// mixed-version-safe: <justification>` above `up` if this drops
//     something old code might still read (see MIGRATIONS.md).
