/**
 * Generic, compile-time-exhaustive part -> T dispatcher.
 *
 * No React import — `T` is typically `ReactNode`, but this file stays
 * framework-free (same reasoning as `classifyPart` itself) so a host isn't
 * forced through React to use it. It lives under `react/chat/` because that's
 * where the rest of the chat-rendering surface is, not because it needs React.
 *
 * `PartRenderers<T>` requires a renderer for every `ClassifiedPart['kind']`
 * (an optional `fallback` covers `'unknown'`-only handling, or lets a host
 * opt out of exhaustiveness during a migration) — TypeScript itself enforces
 * that a host's switch-equivalent covers every part kind, closing the
 * "silently drops subtask/patch/snapshot/agent/retry/compaction" bug class at
 * the CALL site the same way `classifyPart` closes it at the classification
 * site.
