/**
 * The name an account gets when nobody has chosen one yet (KRTX-638).
 *
 * Never the full email address. The old default was `"<email>'s Account"`,
 * which then sat in the sidebar, the account picker, the hub and the admin
 * console for every user who never renamed it. In order of preference:
 *
 *   1. the person's first name       → "Ada's workspace"
 *   2. no profile name              → "My workspace"
 *
 * The DOMAIN is never used: most people sign up with a consumer address, and
 * an account called "Gmail" is wrong for all of them.
 *
 * Existing chosen account names are preserved by the callers.
